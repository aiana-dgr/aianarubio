        <h2>Video Game as a Form of Art</h2>
        <p>Art is produced by human imagination and creative skills. It is made to be appreciated by its beauty, its
            story,
            its message or its emotional property. Commonly known constituents of the arts are literary arts: like poems
            and
            novels, visual arts: like paintings and architecture, and performing arts: like music and dance. But where
            do
            video games fall under? The question of whether video games are worthy enough to be considered as an art
            form is
            still a controversial topic. Video games exhibit imagination and creative skills not just by graphics but
            even
            by its story telling and music which attest they are an art form.</p>
        <p>The fact that video games comprise other forms of art supports this argument. “Video games have become an
            amalgam
            of traditional art forms -- and have become one in its own right”, argues Chris Melissinos, a gaming expert
            and
            the author of “The Art of Video Games: From Pac-Man to Mass Effect”. Starting with a game’s graphic design
            which
            is usually what the user or the player will initially notice, Chris Melissinos mentioned forms of
            traditional
            artistic expression that are involved in its making like – “sculpture in the form of 3D modeling and
            illustration”. The texts on the title screen, the characters, the worlds, and even the smallest objects that
            make up a video game are drawn, painted, textured and enhanced through digital tools, or in some cases, are
            even
            hand-crafted and are digitized in order to be imported as part of the game’s art design. This process of
            creating these elements of a video game demonstrates the artistic skills and talent of the individual or the
            people behind its design.</p>
        <p>Another aspect in which meaningful and engaging experiences will be encountered is in the video games’
            storytelling. Games like Assassins Creed, Prince of Persia and Tomb Raider, have film adaptations because of
            their rich and fascinating narratives. A video game’s story development is challenging because they’re
            interactive. The players are part of the experience so game designers must aspire for high level of
            entertainment and emotional involvement. And this is what makes video games unique. The story of the author
            bound by the rules of the game is followed by the players, which allows them immersion in how the story
            would
            flow, making the experience utterly personal. And “If you can observe the work of another and find in it
            personal connection, then art has been achieved”, said Chris Melissinos.</p>
        <p>Contradictory, a film critic, Roger Ebert, gained a lot of attention in the mid-2000s when he made a claim
            that
            “video games can never be art”. His claim ignited a controversy across the gaming and art community. He
            stated,
            “To my knowledge, no one in or out of the field has ever been able to cite a game worthy of comparison with
            the
            great dramatists, poets, filmmakers, novelists and composers. That a game can aspire to artistic importance
            as a
            visual experience, I accept. But for most gamers, video games represent a loss of those precious hours we
            have
            available to make ourselves more cultured, civilized and empathetic.” Ebert’s very own statement displays
            irony
            when he said that he accepts a game to aspire to artistic importance as a visual experience. Art works, as
            Google suggested, are “produced to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power”. The visual
            experience
            video games offer, with the addition of engaging storylines, profound dialogues and revered music, are
            synonymous to what art should be recognized for. Furthermore, common misconceptions about video games
            include
            the descriptions that Roger Ebert used to account the loss of precious hours most gamers could have rather
            used
            for. Most gamers are often assumed to be anti-socials. However, because of the internet and with some games
            no
            longer playable offline, gaming is already being viewed as a social activity which contributes to social
            development and the empathy of its users.</p>
        <p>The video game industry is rapidly growing and evolving. Could it be that these electronic games are so
            dynamic
            that it had actually gone beyond the conventional properties of art for most people to see them as its form?
            Games are meant to engage its users in its story, or to take you to a whole new virtual dimension while
            listening to its music that invoke wide range of emotions in a way that no other medium could, which is why
            art
            predecessors discern games as interlopers of the art world. These games immerse you to an interactive
            experience
            that is the result of its creators’ expression of their creativity and imagination.</p>
