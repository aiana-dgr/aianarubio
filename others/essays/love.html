        <h2>Love Letter</h2>
        <h4>Dear Desktop Computer,</h4>
        <p>The first thought of having you live with us already sparked so much excitement in me! I remember the days
            when
            we were preparing for your arrival. We made re-arrangements in the room, and took our time looking for the
            right
            table for you because I know that’s what you’ll need the most. It makes me happy looking at you sitting
            pretty
            on your table with your 23” Full HD display and the vibrant coloured LED fans on your system unit.</p>
        <p>The day my husband got home all pumped up to tell me it was time to get you is vividly on my mind. It was a
            little past noon, very hot and sunny outside, and our only means of transporting is our electronic bike, but
            all
            that we disregard because we were intertwined with the same objective- to bring you home. You have brought
            me
            and my husband closer. We found you together. We have worked hand-in-hand from preparing everything for your
            arrival, to setting you up before we left the computer shop, and finally on having you settled in.</p>
        <p>Being best buddies with you was instant from the moment I met you. You are my constant companion. You are
            there
            on laid back days when all we do is to explore and have adventures on our favourite video games, or laugh
            together on funny videos or binge-watch our favourite shows. Then you stay up with me during sleepless
            nights of
            research, study and even final exams. You are my go-to when I need cooking recipes, parenting guides or when
            I
            need to write because you’re always ready to help. </p>
        <p>I promise to take good care of you. You have shown exemplary performance since I added more memory to you. I
            also
            planned a routine check and clean up to make sure you stay healthy and safe from any virus. I can picture my
            kids growing up with you by our side. I appreciate that you do your best, despite long hours of working, in
            order to accommodate and help not just me but anyone who might need you in our family. You are and will
            always
            be a precious addition to this home.</p>
        <span>Love,</span>
