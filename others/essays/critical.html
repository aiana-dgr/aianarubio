        <h2>Money and Happiness</h2>
        <p>Modern society today could not function without money. It is the current medium of exchange. Economies rely
            on the exchange of money for products and services. But what is the role of money in creating happiness? Can
            money make you happy? Or is it true, what they say, that “Money can’t buy happiness.”? Money can make us
            happy because life without it is really hard. There are many ways it can make us happy.</p>
        <p>To start with, it is easy to understand that people who have enough to cover rent or housing, food and
            clothing would most likely be happier than people who struggle to pay their bills. Knowing that we have
            enough money to spend on our basic necessities gives us peace of mind. And real happiness is borne out of a
            peaceful mind.</p>
        <p>Some may say that once you’re able to provide for your basic needs, money and material items are a lot less
            likely to make you happy. However, having security allows the wealthy to explore more active ways of
            experiencing the world. Money plays a bigger role in our lives and in the society in variety of ways. Such
            as in business, money helps people achieve a larger chance of business success. Even in education, money
            allows people achieve a higher quality of education. People value education highly in their lives and a
            quality education brings oneself a higher possibility to succeed in the future. These achievements generate
            greater happiness, satisfaction and joy. </p>
        <p>Additionally, money opens more opportunities for people to give and to help others. A study by Molly and
            Grafman in 2006, showed the biological implications of “altruistic behaviour”, or the behaviour that show a
            desire to help other people, in brain scans. In their study, “The anterior prefrontal cortex lit up in scans
            of brains of the altruistic.” This shows that people get a feeling of great happiness and excitement from
            the act of giving. So, spend money on others. Giving money or gifts strengthens social bonds, which amplify
            happiness.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, money does play a role in creating happiness. Living in a financially stable home improves
            your happiness. Having enough money to live on can ease anxiety, it refrains you from worrying and allows
            you to enjoy life. The feeling of security that wealth gives is the key to happiness. Life satisfaction,
            sense of worth and happiness can grow higher, as the level of wealth increases, as long as you keep in mind
            how to spend it right.</p>
