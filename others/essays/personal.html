        <h2>The Day I Lost My First Best Friend</h2>
        <p>I was a pretty confident child. Family and relatives remember me as such, too. They say I talked a lot, I
            asked questions a lot (even to grown-ups I’ve just met) and I was eager to push my limits. Like to see how
            quickly I could jump over the water meters across a street, an idea which carved a big scar on my knee. I
            was strong-willed probably because from my earliest memory, I knew someone had my back – my older brother.
        </p>
        <p>At about the age of 4, I remember my mom being so mad at me for something I know I did but can’t recall what
            it was exactly. She decided to put me on time out for it. It felt forever for the first few minutes(maybe
            seconds because I was a kid who exaggerates), but my older brother chose to keep me company even if that
            meant we’ll both have to stay there longer, because we ended up giggling which got into our mom’s nerves so
            much. But from that moment on, we were inseparable. We had each other’s backs. We were best friends.</p>
        <p>Our family moved a lot from when I was in 1st grade to 6th grade because of my dad’s job. We had to transfer
            schools every year, sometimes twice in one year. Our strong sibling bond helped us get through the pressure
            of new environment, the struggle of making new friends, and even a few school bullies along the way. But
            even if there’s nothing quite like a sibling bond, this deep connection is still vulnerable to negative
            experiences that one may find hard to let go of.</p>
        <p>When I was about 8, our family moved to a rural area. Our house was literally beside the rice fields and we
            were just a few minutes’ walk to a river at the foot of a mountain. It was paradise! Our parents were away
            or preoccupied most of the time which gave us lots of time to play and explore outside. This was when my
            brother and I flew our first hand-made kites, got to climb lots of trees, caught snails, dragonflies and
            tadpoles, and even made a secret base inside a broken and abandoned steam-roller. I felt as if I wasn’t
            scared of anything. I thought I’d always have someone to back me up. And I know my brother thought the same.
        </p>
        <p>During the summer of that year, my mom got back home after being away for a few days with nice new pairs of
            flip-flops for me and my brother. With so much excitement to show them off, we went out to play right away.
            One of our friends strongly suggested that we walk to the river to take our new flip-flops for a run-in. My
            brother was of course hesitant, but as for me, I was up for the challenge. Nevertheless, I was able to
            pressure him to come along because I knew he would go if I’ll go. When we got to the river, all the other
            kids started swimming. My brother grabbed me on my shoulder to stop me, but the water was so inviting, so I
            shoved his hand and went right into the water. I remember him just sitting under a tree while watching us
            splash and have fun. I thought, while a bit annoyed, why does he have to be such a party pooper?</p>
        <p>The other kids then started to move to the deeper part of the river. I’ve tried going there before, with our
            parents around, so I thought it’s something I know I could take. But the river’s current that day was a bit
            stronger. I know our friends felt it too so they went out the water and ran back to where we came from
            leaving me behind. I struggled a little, which I think I noticed from my peripheral view made my brother
            stand from where he’s sitting, but I was able to grab onto a big rock that helped me get out of the water,
            then I was ready to run after our friends. “Kamiiiiil!” my brother called my name which made me look back.
            The first thing I saw was his flip-flop moving fast with the water current, then him struggling to swim(or
            run, I wasn’t sure) to go after it. I ran on the side of the river to get close to the flip-flop and see if
            I could, in some way, grab it from where I was without getting in the water. But I couldn’t. I started to
            panic! I told my brother to just let it go and get out of the water but he insisted we had to get it. We
            both knew how disappointed my mom would be if she found out he lost one of his newly bought flip-flops. And
            it’s probably going to take a few months before he gets a new pair because money was hard at the time. I
            wasn’t sure what to be scared about anymore, us drowning or losing his flip-flop and our mom’s dismay. We
            kept on following it until the current finally slowed down a little, my brother still in the water, and me
            still on the side of the river. The flip-flop was then floating on a greener part of the water, I had a
            feeling the water level could be deep so I told my brother not to risk it. I started to voice out the things
            I started to imagine, like there might be a crocodile in the water and that I was picturing one of the
            scenes from the Anaconda film. But he was determined to get it and tried to swim to it but it was too deep.
            He started to panic and grasped for air. He begged for me to help him. I froze for a bit. We both didn’t
            know how to swim so I knew I can’t do anything to help so I then ran as fast as I could hoping I would find
            someone, a grown-up to help him, but it took me longer than I hoped for. It took me forever. Next thing I
            knew, he was already behind me with his flip-flops on. I was stunned that he was okay! I had no idea how he
            got out of the water. I wasn’t sure how to react, but I was delighted he was alive! Then he glanced at me
            with pure dismay. I felt his anger as he walked right past me. It killed my courage to explain that I tried
            to look for help… He thought I left him.</p>
        <p>From then on, he was distant. It was never the same. My first childhood best friend, even though I’m sure it
            was my own brother, now in my memory seems to me like a totally different person. For a while I wished I
            stayed and tried harder to help. I planned a few times to explain what I tried to do then, but I would
            always end up chickening out. I guess the confidence I had faded together with our closeness. I let fear,
            and misplaced pride, allow us to grow apart. But I hope to one day find the courage to let him know that I
            tried.</p>
