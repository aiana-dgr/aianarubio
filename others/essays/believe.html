        <h2>Benefits of Music</h2>
        <p>I believe that music affects our mind. I believe that if we are aware of the music that we listen to, it
            could be more than being the art of combining vocals and instrumental sounds. Music can help us in many
            ways.</p>
        <p>When I was in my senior high school, it was a surprise when my parents separated. My mom left me and my two
            sisters with my Dad. I was not sure how I should have felt. I don’t remember reacting to any of it until I
            was living with my mom again, a year after they separated. I guess I just kept my feelings to myself. But I
            remember that I preferred to listen to sad music after what had happened.</p>
        <p>An earlier study published in the Journal of Consumer Research, found that people tend to prefer sad music
            when they are experiencing a deep interpersonal loss. The authors of that study suggested that sad music
            provides a substitute for the lost relationship. They compared it to the preference most people have for an
            emphatic friend – someone who truly understands what they are going through.</p>
        <p>Classical music or music with relaxing tune can help us fall asleep. When I became a mom, I started having
            encounters with sleepless nights. And when I finally have the chance to doze off, I’m often too tired to do
            so. This is when I learned that slow tuned music is what I need. It helps not only me, but my little ones
            fall asleep as well. I also find listening to instrumental ambient sounds helpful in focusing when I’m
            studying or writing a paper. And I believe that listening to upbeat music can make us happy, and happiness
            can lead to better physical health and greater productivity.</p>
        <p>I believe that music is more than just art. When I listen to music, the consequence is beyond feeling good. I
            believe music has the power to stir our mood and emotions which we can maneuver by choosing the right songs
            to listen to, and the effect can be surprisingly beneficial.</p>
