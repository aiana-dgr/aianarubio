            <p class="home-paragraph-1">
                I have always loved video games most especially retro ones- the classics. I remember the first time I
                got my hands on a black and white brick game at the age of 4 and played my very first game of Tetris, it
                just blew my mind off! Then there came the Famicom console which was a boom here in the Philippines
                around the late 80's, up to my early childhood years which was around the late 90's and that was just
                exciting. I loved Galaga, of course the famous Super Mario Bros., Adventure Island, Contra and so much
                more. I am grateful for the internet of things which also gave me the chance to experience the gameplay
                of the games before my generation now, like Space Invaders which was initially released for Atari 2600.
                Also loved coin-operated arcades since owning a game console was pretty expensive back then, which gave
                me the chance to enjoy from Pac-Man all the way to Marvel VS. Capcom. In my amazement and love for those
                video games, as a child I began to wonder how they were created and hoped that someday I would be able
                to make my own game.

                <h2>About this Website</h2>
                <p>
                    This web site is about my learning journey and my love for video games. I will share the steps and
                    the bumps of game development that I will take and encounter as I create simple video games using
                    Python. Even though I may have barely scratched the surface of python game development, web design
                    and web development, learning more excites me and this web site gives me the chance to apply what I
                    learn and share them at the same time.
                    <br>
                    Do you love playing video games? Ever tried a game and wondered how it came about? The code of the
                    games, and the instructions of how to make the games will all be on this web site, plus you get to
                    watch clips of gameplay and even download the python files for the games I made here too!
